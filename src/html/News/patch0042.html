        <h2 class="section-title">Update</h2>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle"><i>Patch 0.0.42</i></h3>
            <h5 style="color:whitesmoke"><i>Spiny ran out of space in the original push and needed to also merge in the
                    other features he was working on.</i></h5>
            <br>
            <p>Subtitle says it all. Let's get this over with. Namely because we've implemented a few new AFK QOL
                features, along with [drum roll]...</p>
            <br>
            <h1>
                <i> Colored subtitles</i>
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>Incredible I know right? Alright let get this moving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Running animation changes.</h3>
            <p>As of now, you weren't able to choose running and idle animations for Co-Op. Each operator had one of
                four options:</p>
            <div class="patch-note">
                <ul>
                    <li>High ready sprint/idle (think of tac sprinting in COD)</li>
                    <li>Low ready sprint/idle (think of your normal sprint animation in battlefield)</li>
                    <li>Weapon sling sprint/idle (think of how Big Boss runs when not ADS'd in MGSV)</li>
                    <li>Roadie Run/Idle (think of Ghost Recon Future Soldier or Gears of War and how characters sprint
                        between cover)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>It's namely something as a precursor to our character creator, but we wanted to implement the options for
                operators in Calamari prior to it. It's only visual, doesn't provide any bonuses.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-AFK turn skipping/Mission Drop In </h3>
            <p>Another thing we noticed and wanted to curb were issues with players taking a bit too long. It's bad form
                to go play another game while a mission is running, and we're cracking down a little to help make
                missions and encounters move faster
            </p>
            <p>As such, we've implemented a system, quite simple really. If we see inactivity for a minute, a two minute
                timer will begin. Once that timer runs out, the turn will skip and it will be considered a 'no-op' or
                just nothing happens. Due to them being AFK, we will specifically have enemies not target them for
                fairness. Similar to Rp6's tag team system where secondary operators are moved to rear guard.
            </p>
            <p> As for mission drop ins, we're implementing a feature to allow for players to read the mission brief
                before they jump into a mission. In addition, they also won't be able to enter into an encounter until
                the encoutner ends and the area is clear.
            </p>
            <p>We hope to try and curb some of the other things that slow down the gameplay through these, and as always
                we're open to feedback on how to keep the gameplay moving.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Radio bracket Coloring</h3>
            <p> One of the issues with Rp6's radio bracketing was that it relied on prose a lot to determine what radio
                was being heard. In this quick patch, we want to address this by introducing some new radio coloring to
                help. </p>

            <div class="patch-note">
                <ul> 
                    <li><span style="color:deepskyblue">`<<>>`</span> -represents in team comms. Only the members in your fireteam can hear what is being said over this frequency. Note, doesn't stop enemies from being able to hear you yell things out  </li>
                    <li><span style="color:greenyellow">`<<>>`</span> -represents friendly comms. Any friendlies in the area can hear what is being said on this frequency. same rules apply as team comms. </li>
                    <li><span style="color:red">`<<>>`</span> -represents enemy comms. Unless a friendly has picked up an enemy radio at some point during the mission, these comms are inaudible to the team. Enemies can also change frequency to throw you off.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:yellow">`<<>>`</span> -represents neutral comms. These are commonly civilians or unknowns, and are also audible to the team via their radios if tuned into the right frequency. </li>
            </div>  
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Swapped Shields to Fire Support Class </h3>
            <p>One of the main issues with rifleman was that they had a lot of options. Shields,  the M26 MASS, and then the 40mm Gl provided a lot of  options to Riflemen while Supports were stuck with either machine guns or  mortars. Both good, but were similar in gameplay. 
            </p>
            <p>Also because we wanted each  class to have 4 subclasses, so we moved shields to fire support.</p>
