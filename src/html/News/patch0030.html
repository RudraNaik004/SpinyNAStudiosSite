        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle"><i>Patch 0.03</i></h3>
            <h5 style="color:whitesmoke"><i>Snake eyes... Again.</i></h5>
            <br>
            <p>Man I am so happy we never made that May release window for Calamari since good lord our QA testing was
                not as rigorous as what our playtesters are putting the game through. But I digress, and am extremely
                happy either way.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Patch 0.03 of the Calamari Alpha Playtest. As a lot of you know by now we’ve shifted away from
                the old director system, scrapped any remnants of the Genesis system, and moved into integrating SCUMM
                for a more dynamic gameplay experience. Though, as we’ve learned from the first playtest a few weeks
                back—a lot of things need tweaking. So let’s go through some of the dev notes for the 0.03 patch, shall
                we?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Improved check overlay</h3>
            <p>One thing we noticed is that during dialogue, when the 'director' threw out a check to provide
                information to players, was that the interface was prone to look a little confusing at times, and also
                be a bit slow to show information. We want to distinguish information from a check with actual prose and
                dialogue a bit to reduce confusion before it becomes something we need to worry about later. So we’re
                going to push a change this patch that might look a bit familiar...</p>

            <div class="patch-note">
                <p>Computers [Success] - You understand the term 'director' from an earlier patch notes. It was
                    mentioned that it was the main way that the game determines what encounters happen, and how they
                    happen. Almost like a movie director and exactly like how a specific valve game implemented it, one
                    that was left for dead.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="patch-note">
                <p>Trivia [Failure] - The presentation of this information vexes you. The name
                    is on the tip of your tongue and it sounds like some sort of dance game… At least you think it does.
                    It did have ‘disco’ in it.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Armor and Cover</h3>
            <p>Another thing we noticed from the first playtest is that enemies were absurdly difficult to kill at times
                due to over-tuned armor values and positional bonuses from cover. We originally removed the positional
                bonuses, and made armor values a threshold you need to surpass, but against high armor enemies it made
                hitting them or doing damage nigh impossible. So we changed that back to it being a dice roll using the
                enemy’s defense stat.</p>
            <p>In an earlier hotfix we changed enemy armor to be much lower, in the range of armor 1 and 2, to lower the
                thresholds needed to cause damage and wounds to an enemy. So far, for chaff, it’s worked quite well! But
                we have the other issue now of cover not helping them at all when it comes to their defense. So now that
                they’re more squishy, we’re re-enabling cover adjustments and possibly distance modifiers for the next
                session.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Movement</h3>
            <p>Yeah we’re still trying to sort this one our ourselves too… But, we do want to emphasize player movement
                a bit more during combat. One thing we’re planning to push this patch is a change to cover mechanics to
                introduce flanking to completely negate the effects of a cover bonus. In addition, movement from cover
                to cover will take one turn, and you’ll be able to shoot while moving a bit easier to compensate, but
                also vulnerable until your next turn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="patch-section">
            <h3 class="patch-subtitle">-Final Notes</h3>
            <p>I would write something witty or sappy here… But I don’t think there’s much to say that I haven’t
                already. All the changes will be put into the full patch notes below. We do have some future stuff
                planned, like a progression system for gadgets, support for 8 player co-op, changes to the gadget
                selection and loadout, close air support being a bit more prevalent, and then possibly improvements to
                vehicular combat (right now we’re basically treating it as impenetrable to small arms and extremely
                vulnerable to AT if its armored), and more.</p>
            <p>But I digress. Patch notes below, send your feedback in the ⁠calamari-discussion channel if you’ve got
                notes and comments, and feel free to throw suggestions our way.</p>
            <p>I could really go for some legally distinct orange soda...</p>
